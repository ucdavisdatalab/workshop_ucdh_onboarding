# Permissions with Service Now

UCDH's computing resources and IT services all require individual permission to
use. Generally, the way to get that permission is to request it through UCDH's
[Service Now catalog][service-now].

[service-now]: https://ucdh.service-now.com

The Service Now catalog has entries for services such as the virtual private
network (VPN), REDCap, keycard access to buildings, networked mass storage, and
access to datasets. It includes almost anything you might need from an access
and security perspective.


We recommend using the catalog's keyword search to find the services you need.
Type a keyword into the search bar and pick from the list of results. Where
there are multiple options for the same service, pay attention to which one
applies to your affiliation with UCDH. If you're a student or employee at the
Davis campus, select the option for "Davis Employee" or "External Employee". 

For example, suppose you're an employee at the Davis campus and want to get VPN
access. The following screenshot shows a search for "VPN" with the "External
Employee" option highlighted:

for the term VPN and selecting the option called "Remote Access - VPN -
    External Employee".](/images/vpn-select-screenshot.png)

On the next screen, select the option that says you are a "Contractor", and put
a note in the "Comments" box that says you are an employee on the Davis campus,
and that indicates the project and relevant PI at the hospital. Then you can
add the VPN service to your cart.

Once you've added something to your cart, you check out as if Service Now is an
online shopping site. You won't have to pay but you will have to fill out
fields that explain why you need the service and who to talk to for approval of
the request. Generally, that will be either your supervisor or the researcher
with whom you are collaborating---ask around if you're not sure.
