# CITI Training for Handling Protected Information

There are (at least) two kinds of data that you have to be careful about when working with human-subjects data: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). There is a confusingly large number of protective tiers and policies for this information, which are seemingly independently set by the UC system, UC Davis, and the UC Davis Medical Center. But these policies are all meant to enforce the basic rule that that there be no unauthorized access to these data. The systems and procedures described in this guide exist so that PHI and PII can be hosted securely on servers owned by UCDH and located on UCDH property, while still allowing authorized researchers to do their work even if they're not physically at the hospital. Part of becoming an authorized user is getting your "CITI training" to learn about protected data.

## CITI Training
The rules that govern medical research ethics in the United States apply to nearly all researchers and institutions, while compliance relies on individual actions. This puts institutions in an uncomfortable bind because they may be liable for the decisions of individual researchers who have idiosyncratic ideas of ethical research practices. The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) is one way that institutions are attempting to systematize training in medical research ethics.

Take your CITI training seriously â€” it is very easy to expose protected data in ways that are impossible to undo.

In order to access some services provided by UCDH, you may need CITI training. UC Davis is a member of CITI so you will create an account at [citiprogram.org](https://citiprogram.org) that is linked to your UC Davis identity. Then you will be able to add trainings or yourself. In order to handle medical data at UC Davis, you must complete at least the "Basic Course" for the role "Biomedical Researchers and Staff". This involves reading course material and then answering an online quiz to complete the certification. The training is then valid for three years.

## CITI Training
The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) was begun as a parnership between the University of Miami and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It provides a standardized, peer-reviewd set of trainings that are meant to educate people about the laws and ethics of human-subjects reasearch. You'll need to complete the "Basic" training for biomedical researchers. Here is how to do that:

- Go to [citiprogram.org](https://www.citiprogram.org).
- Clock "Login" and at the login page, select "Log In Through my Institution".
- Fill in your UC Davis uername and password, and verify your identity via Duo.
- Scroll down to "Learner Tools for University of California, Davis" and click "Add A Course".
- Check the box for "I need to enroll in required Institutional Review Board (IRB) training" and click "Next".
- Select the box for "Basic Course of Biomedical Researchers" and click "Next".
- Generally, you are not going to be engaged in a clinical trial so select the box for "I am not engaged in a clinical investigation or an NIH-funded clinical trial. I do not need to complete GCP training at this time." and click "Next".

At this point, you should be able to confirm that you are enrolling in the Basic Course for Biomedical Researchers. Complete the course (it should take a few hours to read everything and then answer the quizzes), and you'll get an email with a certificate. Someone will eventually need that certificate from you, so just hold on to it for now.
