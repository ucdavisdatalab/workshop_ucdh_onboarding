# CITI Training

The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) provides
peer-reviewed courses to educate researchers about ethical and legal best
practices for human subjects research. Originally a partnership between the
University of Miami and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, CITI now
coordinates with academic and government institutions nationwide.

Before you begin any medical or human subjects research, make sure to complete
the required CITI training courses, which vary depending on the nature of the
research. If you're unsure which courses are required, contact your principal
investigator, department chair, or institutional review board (IRB).

Take your CITI training seriously---it's very easy to accidentally expose
protected data in ways that are impossible to undo.

To get started, register for an account on the [CITI Program website][CITI],
making sure to do so as an affiliate of UC Davis. At UC Davis, CITI's
"Biomedical Research - Basic" course is a minimum requirement to conduct
biomedical research. To enroll:

1. Log into the [CITI Program website][CITI] with your UC Davis-affiliated
   account.
2. Find the list of courses you've taken for UC Davis. You can usually find
   this from the "My Courses" page.
3. Find and click on the "Add a Course" link. You can usually find this at the
   bottom of the list of courses.
4. Check the box for "I need to enroll in required Institutional Review Board
   (IRB) training". Review the other options and click "Next" when you're done.
5. Select the box for "Basic Course of Biomedical Researchers". Review the
   other options and click "Next" when you're done.
6. Answer whether you are engaged in a clinical trial as part of the research
   and click "Next" when you're done.

At this point, you should be able to confirm that you are enrolling in the
"Biomedical Research - Basic" course for "Biomedical Researchers and Staff".
Complete the course (it will take a few hours to read through the material and
answer the quiz questions) and save your completion certificates somewhere
(they will also be emailed to you). In the future, you may need to provide
those certificates to the IRB or UC Davis administrators to prove you completed
the course. This course is valid for 3 years, after which you'll be prompted to
complete a refresher course.


### Protected Data

There are (at least) two kinds of data that you have to be careful about when working with human-subjects data: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI). There is a confusingly large number of protective tiers and policies for this information, which are seemingly independently set by the UC system, UC Davis, and the UC Davis Medical Center. But these policies are all meant to enforce the basic rule that that there be no unauthorized access to these data. The systems and procedures described in this guide exist so that PHI and PII can be hosted securely on servers owned by UCDH and located on UCDH property, while still allowing authorized researchers to do their work even if they're not physically at the hospital. Part of becoming an authorized user is getting your "CITI training" to learn about protected data.
