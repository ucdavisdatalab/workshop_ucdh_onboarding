Introduction

Getting started on a collaboration with a scientist from the UC Davis Hospital can be tough! This guide is intended to help you avoid some of the pitfalls that have affected our collaborations in the past. Studying human subjects is sensitive for a lot of obvious reasons thatI'm not going to get into here because you'r going to learn about them in the online training that you're required to complete before you can work with data. Speaking of which, the first things you'l have to do are twofold and can be pursued in parallel: complete your CITI training and get an Active Directory (AD) account.

## CITI Training
The Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) was begun as a parnership between the University of Miami and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. It provides a standardized, peer-reviewd set of trainings that are meant to educate people about the laws and ethics of human-subjects reasearch. You'll need to complete the "Basic" training for biomedical researchers. Here is how to do that:

- Go to [citiprogram.org](https://www.citiprogram.org).
- Clock "Login" and at the login page, select "Log In Through my Institution".
- Fill in your UC Davis uername and password, and verify your identity via Duo.
- Scroll down to "Learner Tools for University of California, Davis" and click "Add A Course".
- Check the box for "I need to enroll in required Institutional Review Board (IRB) training" and click "Next".
- Select the box for "Basic Course of Biomedical Researchers" and click "Next".
- Generally, you are not going to be engaged in a clinical trial so select the box for "I am not engaged in a clinical investigation or an NIH-funded clinical trial. I do not need to complete GCP training at this time." and click "Next".

At this point, you should be able to confirm that you are enrolling in the Basic Course for Biomedical Researchers. Complete the course (it should take a few hours to read everything and then answer the quizzes), and you'll get an email with a certificate. Someone will eventually need that certificate from you, so just hold on to it for now.

## Get an Active Directory (AD) Account
UCDH has a completely separate IT system from the Davis campus. One consequence is that your Davis campus login won't work on hospital systems. You'll need an account on the UCDH computer system before anything will work for you. This is called an Active Driectory (AD) account because the hospital uses a windows network drive, for which AD is the login manager. To request an AD account requires being logged in on an active AD account, whih sounds like a catch-22. The solution is that someone else must request the AD account for you, and it must also be approved by a supervisor. So, probably talk to Carl about having him request the account.
