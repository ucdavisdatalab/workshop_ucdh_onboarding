# Introduction

Before we dive into how to get started with UCDH computing resources, we have a
few notes about how to use and understand this guide and how to get help along
the way.


## Terminology

This guide uses the following terminology and acronyms:

* **UCDH**: the entire UC Davis Health institution, encompassing both clinical
  and educational units across all physical locations.
* **UCDH IT**: information technology units and services at UCDH.
* **UCDMC**: the UC Davis Medical Center at 4301 X Street in Sacramento, CA.
* **Davis campus**: the UC Davis campus in Davis, CA.

If you feel the terminology in this workshop could be made clearer, more
accurate, or more inclusive (for example, by using different terminology or
referring to specific units within UCDH), please [click here][issues] to file
an issue with the maintainers.

## Why This Guide?

The UCDH IT team produces and maintains many volumes of documentation about
computing resources at UCDH, such as their detailed [knowledge base][], but
these are typically intended for experienced researchers who already know what
they need. As researchers from the Davis campus with no prior experience
collaborating with UCDH, we found navigating UCDH's computing resources
overwhelming despite the documentation, akin climbing up a smooth wall. We hope
to guide you toward the most secure footholds as you make your way up the
metaphorical rock face. Success for your authors is you learning to recognize
the way forward and go on independently.


## Getting Help

The [knowledge base][] maintained by UCDH IT is full of useful information.
It's part of the Service Now system (see {ref}`chapter:service-now`), so you
won't be able to access it until you have an AD account (see
{ref}`chapter:active-directory`). The knowledge base articles are generally
authoritative but written for people who already know what they need. We
encourage you to start searching the knowledge base to supplement this guide as
soon as you have access.

The UCDH IT team also runs a [ticket system][] where you can get help directly
from them. As with the knowledge base, you'll need to log into Service Now
before you can submit a ticket.
