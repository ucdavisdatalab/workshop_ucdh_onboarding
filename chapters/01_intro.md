Introduction
===============

Getting started on a collaboration with a scientist from the UC Davis Medical Center can be tough! This guide is intended to help you avoid some of the pitfalls that have affected our collaborations in the past. Studying human subjects is sensitive for a lot of obvious reasons that I'm not going to get into here because you're going to learn about them in the online training that you're required to complete before you can work with data. That training is the subject of {ref}`chapter:citi-training`. Before moving on, though, we have a few quick notes about how to understand this guide.

## A Note On Terminology
This guide uses the acronym UCDH to refer to UC Davis Health, which is an institution that encompasses the clinical and educational parts of the medical center. In the same vein, we use the acronym UCDH IT to refer to information technology and services provided by UCDH. If you believe that the guide would be made clearer by, e.g., referring specifically to the hospital, the medical school, or a specific team working within UCDH IT, then please [click here to raise an issue with the authors](https://github.com/ucdavisdatalab/workshop_ucdh_onboarding/issues).


## Why This Guide?
There is a lot of information about UCDH IT systems written by the UCDH IT staff. This guide is written by outside researchers, which gives us a different perspective. When we first began collaborating with researchers in UCDH, the process was something like climbing a climbing a smooth wall. We hope to guide you toward the most secure footholds as you make your way up the metaphorical rock face. Success for your authors is when you have learned to recognize the way forward and can go on independently.



## A Note on Getting Help
The IT team at UCDH maintains a [Knowledge Base linked here](https://ucdh.service-now.com/itss?id=kb_home). It is part of the Service Now system (described in {ref}`chapter:service-now`), so you won't be able to access it until you have an AD account (see {ref}`chapter:active-directory`.) The knowledge base articles are generally authoritative but written for people who already know what they need. We encourage you to start searching the knowledge base to supplement this guide as soon as you have access.
