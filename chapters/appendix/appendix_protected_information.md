# Protected Information
UCDH and the people working on its behalf have an ethical and legal responsibility to protect patients and research subjects, including to protect them from exposure of their private information. Protected Health Information (PHI) and Personally Identifiable Information (PII) are the two main categories of information for which protections are enacted in law.

## Personally Identifiable Information


## Data Sharing
The University of California has been working since 2018 to implement a protocol for sharing health data. That effort generated the [2024 UC health data governance task force report, linked here](https://ucop.edu/uc-health/reports-resources/uchealth-data-governance-task-force-report_2024_final_06272024.pdf). It is beyond the scope of this document to describe the entire report, so let's just summarize a few key points:

- Sharing health data generally requires approval from the health data oversight committee (HDOC). Each UC campus with a medical center (including UC Davis) has established an HDOC and there is also a central UC HDOC. Decision of the HDOC are supposed to be guided by justice. In general, this seems to align with the previous principle of informed consent, but with some greater scrutiny when research on health data may have social impacts or lead to for-profit products or services.
- De-identifying data is not sufficient to allow sharing health data because it can be sometimes be easily re-identified by combining with publicly- or commercially-available data.
- There is an exception for research data to not be treated as health data, which means it can be shared without seeking permission from the HDOC. This exception applies to some data that were collected with informed consent for a research project that was overseen by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).
- The exception **only** applies to data that were collected for no purpose other than research. In general, this means that clinical data are excluded from the exception.
