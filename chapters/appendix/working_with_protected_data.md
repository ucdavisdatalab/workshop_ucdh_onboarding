# Working with Protected Data

Anyone working with patients or research subjects has an ethical and legal
responsibility to act in their best interests. This includes protecting them
from exposure of their private data. As a result, the University of California,
UC Davis, and UCDH all have policies to protect sensitive data such as
personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information
(PHI). Because these policies exist at several different levels of the
organization, they might seem confusing or intimidating, but they're all meant
to enforce the basic principle that that must there be no unauthorized access
to protected data.

For more detail on the protections accorded to PII and PHI, check out UCDH's
[Privacy Policies and Guidelines][ucdh-privacy].

:::

The systems and procedures described in this guide exist so that protected data
can be stored securely on servers owned by UCDH and located on UCDH property,
while still allowing authorized researchers to do their work even if they're
not physically at the hospital. Completing {ref}`chapter:citi-training` is a
prerequisite to working with protected data.


## Protection Levels

The University of California classifies data into [4
categories][uc-protected-data], called **protection levels**, depending on the potential impact of disclosure or compromise. Protection level 1 (P1) consists of data that would have relatively low impact, such as data already publicly available, while protection level 4 (P4) consists of highly sensitive data, such as medical records and financial records.

## Sharing Data

The University of California has been working since 2018 to implement a
protocol for sharing health data. That effort generated the [2024 UC Health
Data Governance Task Force Report][uc-data-gov]. It is beyond the scope of this
document to describe the entire report, so let's just summarize a few key
points:

[uc-data-gov]: https://ucop.edu/uc-health/reports-resources/uchealth-data-governance-task-force-report_2024_final_06272024.pdf

- Sharing health data generally requires approval of your **health data
  oversight committee** (HDOC). Each UC campus with a medical center (including
  UC Davis) has established an HDOC, and there is also a central UC HDOC.
- HDOC decisions are supposed to be guided by justice. In general, this seems
  to align with the previous principle of informed consent, but with some
  greater scrutiny when research on health data may have social impacts or lead
  to for-profit products or services.
- De-identifying data is not sufficient to allow sharing health data because it
  can be sometimes be easily re-identified by combining with publicly- or
  commercially-available data.
- There is an exception for research data to not be treated as health data,
  which means it can be shared without seeking permission from the HDOC. This
  exception applies to some data that were collected with informed consent for
  a research project that was overseen by an Institutional Review Board (IRB).
- The exception *only* applies to data that were collected for no purpose other
  than research. In general, this means that clinical data are excluded from
  the exception.
