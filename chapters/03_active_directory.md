# Get an Active Directory (AD) Account

UCDH has a completely separate IT system from the Davis campus. One consequence is that your Davis campus login won't work on hospital systems. You'll need an account on the UCDH computer system before anything will work for you. This is called an Active Directory (AD) account because the hospital uses Microsoft Active Directory as its central database for managing user identities and authorizations. If you are not a UCDH student or employee then getting an AD account means becoming an external affiliate, even if you are a student or employee on the Davis campus.

You can't submit a request to become an affiliate â€” someone else must do it for you. There is a guide in the knowledge base [at this link](https://ucdh.service-now.com/itss?id=kb_article_view&sys_kb_id=b233d4161bfd5d501c9e4223cd4bcba5) for the requester (remember that *you* can't see the knowledge base until you have an affiliate account.)

The service requestor must have a certain level of status in the UCDH IT system (NOTE: I am not sure who qualifies, only that I [Wes] do not). Their process to order your account goes through the Service Now catalog (see {ref}`chapter:service-now`), which is the subject of the next chapter. See {ref}`section:create-external-affiliate` for details on what the requestor needs to do on your behalf.

Once your AD account is active, you'll be able to log in to UCDH IT services. You can recognize when to use your UCDH AD login because the background image shows the UCDMC campus at night (see screenshot), while the Davis campus login page shows an image of the experimental farm fields. Generally, you must preface your user ID by the three characters `hs\` when logging into UCDH IT services.

If you are a brand new affiliate, you will likely not be able to access any of the IT services that you need for your research. You must place an order for rights to access specific tools from the Service Now catalog, which is the topic of our next chapter.
