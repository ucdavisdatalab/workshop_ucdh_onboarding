# Active Directory (AD) Account

Before you can use any of the computing resources at UCDH, you'll need an
**Active Directory** (AD) account. UCDH uses Microsoft Active Directory as its
central database for managing user identities and authorizations. If you're not
a student or employee at UCDH, then getting an AD account means becoming an
external affiliate, even if you're a student or employee at the Davis campus.

:::{important}
UCDH and the Davis campus have separate IT systems. If you have a Kerberos
account with the Davis campus, it will not work at UCDH and is not a substitute
for an AD account.

<!-- FIXME: who's authorized to submit affiliate requests? -->

In order to become an external affiliate, an authorized UCDH employee must
submit a request on your behalf. The UCDH IT knowledge base provides a [guide
for requesters][ad-account-request] that describes how to submit the request.
See the appendix {ref}`appendix:order-external-affiliate` for more details.

## Claiming Your Account

Once you've been made an external affiliate, go to [this
page][claim-ad-account] to claim your AD account account. The page shows some
information and a link to proceed. Click on the link and you should see the
following screen:

[claim-ad-account]: https://hsiam.ucdavis.edu/selfservice/claimaccount

![Screenshot of the form that allows you to claim your Active Directory account](/images/claim-AD-account.png)

Confirm your identity by entering your full name and date of birth, as well as
one of the following:

- The last four digits of your social security number
- Your UCPath ID number
- Your UC Davis student ID number
- Your external affiliate ID and PIN

In order to claim your account, the details that you enter must match UCDH's
records (as provided by your requester).


## Logging In

Once your AD account is active, you'll be able to log in to UCDH IT services.
Generally, you must prefix your user ID by the three characters `hs\` when
logging into UCDH IT services. Some pages, such as the online AD account login
page, add this prefix automatically if you forget to do so.


:::{tip}
If you have a UCDH AD account and a Davis campus Kerberos account, you can
figure out which login to use from the background image on the login page. The
UCDH AD login page shows the nighttime photo of UCDMC campus, while the Davis
campus Kerberos login page shows a daytime photo of the campus' experimental
farm. For example, here's a screenshot of the UCDH AD login page:

If you're a brand new affiliate, you will likely not yet be able to access any
the computing services you need for your research. You must place an order for
rights to access specific tools from the Service Now catalog, which is the
topic of the {ref}`chapter:service-now` chapter.
