Overview
========

This guide is intended to explain how to connect to technology services that are provided by UC Davis Health (UCDH). The tech systems used by UCDH are almost completely separate from those used by the Davis campus, and there are additional data security methods implemented to protect the human patients and subjects that are involved in medical data.

- Get CITI training for how to handle medical data
- Request new services from the UCDH ServiceNow catalog
- Connect to the UCDH VPN
- Request and connect to a virtual machine using ACE
